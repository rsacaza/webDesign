            <p>1975, c. 29, § 3.1-188.20; 1980, c. 291; 2008, c. 860.</p>

            <h3>§ 3.2-701. Administration; regulations.</h3>
            <p>The Commissioner shall protect the agricultural, horticultural, and other interests of the Commonwealth from plant pests and supervise and direct the execution of this article and regulations adopted hereunder.</p>
            <p>1975, c. 29, § 3.1-188.21; 1980, c. 291; 2000, c. 730; 2008, c. 860.</p>

            <h3>§ 3.2-702. Abundance surveys; eradication or suppression of pests.</h3>
            <p>
                The Commissioner shall direct abundance surveys for plant pests and may carry out operations or measures to locate, suppress, control, eradicate, prevent, or retard the spread of pests.
                When the Commissioner determines that a new or dangerous or highly injurious plant pest exists within the Commonwealth or that an established pest requires control and the nature of the pest dictates immediate action, he may proceed with eradication or suppression.
                Provided further, that whenever the Commissioner intends to go upon any property for the purpose of eradicating or suppressing pests, he shall before entering upon any such property, give a written notice to the owner or occupant thereof at least 24 hours prior to such entry, setting forth in detail the purpose or purposes for which such entry shall be made.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event the Commissioner determines a plant pest does not require immediate action, he shall report his findings, including the nature of the pest and method of proposed treatment, to the Board in writing and to the property owners or persons in charge of the property concerned by printing a copy thereof, at least once, in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the locality concerned.
                In case of objection to the action proposed, an appeal shall lie to the Board.
                Such appeal shall be taken within seven days from the issue of the notice and shall act as a stay of proceedings insofar as the property of the person noting the appeal is concerned until it is heard and decided.
            </p>
            <p>1975, c. 29, § 3.1-188.22; 1980, c. 291; 2008, c. 860.</p>

            <h3>§ 3.2-703. Authority to quarantine.</h3>

                <img src="images/pests_600x400.jpg" alt="Pests Picture">
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board may quarantine the Commonwealth or any portion thereof when it determines that such action is necessary to prevent or retard the spread of a pest into, within, or from the Commonwealth.
                Before a quarantine is adopted, the Board shall, after due public notice, hold a public hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), at which hearing any interested party may appear and be heard either in person or by attorney.
                Notwithstanding the provisions of § 2.2-4002 or any other law to the contrary, the Commissioner may impose a temporary quarantine for a period not to exceed 90 days.
                A public hearing, as provided herein, shall be held if it appears that a quarantine for more than the 90-day period will be necessary to prevent or retard the spread of the pest.
                The Commissioner shall give notice of the establishment of the quarantine in a newspaper having general circulation in the area affected by the quarantine.
                The Commissioner may limit the application of the temporary or permanent quarantine to the infested area and appropriate environs, to be known as the regulated areas, and may without further hearing extend or reduce the regulated area upon publication of a notice to that effect in a newspaper having general circulation in the area affected by the quarantine or by direct written notice to those concerned.
                Any temporary quarantine imposed by the Commissioner or any extensions or reductions in the regulated areas pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting, such review by the Board shall be made within 90 days of the Commissioner's action.
            </p>
            <p>Following establishment of a quarantine, no person shall move any regulated article described in the quarantine or move the pest against which the quarantine is established, within, from, into, or through the Commonwealth contrary to regulations.</p>

            <p>
                The regulations may restrict the movement of the pest and any regulated articles from the regulated area in the Commonwealth into or through other parts of the Commonwealth or other states and from the regulated area in other states into or through the Commonwealth and shall impose such inspection, disinfection, certification, or permit and other requirements as the Commissioner deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this article.
                The Commissioner may issue administrative instructions relating to the enforcement of regulations including acceptable certification procedures, regulated articles, and exemptions.
            </p>
            <p>1975, c. 29, § 3.1-188.23; 1980, c. 291; 2008, c. 860.</p>

            <h3>§ 3.2-704. Quarantine against regulated articles in other states.</h3>
            <p>When the Board has good reason to believe in the existence of infested regulated articles in localities in other states, territories, or countries, or that conditions exist that, in the judgment of the Board, render the importation of such regulated articles from such localities a menace to the health of the Commonwealth, the Board shall, by proclamation, prohibit the importation of any regulated article from any locality of other states, territories, or countries, into the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>1975, c. 29, § 3.1-188.24; 2008, c. 860.</p>

            <h2>Article 2. Pest Control Compact.</h2>

            <h3>§ 3.2-720. Assistance and reimbursement.</h3>
            <ol class="listAlpha">
                <li>
                    Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests.
                    It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
                    <ol class="listNumber">
                        <li>The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of this compact.</li>
                        <li>The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this compact.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests,
                    and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the governing board to authorize expenditures from the insurance fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent,
                    or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state.
                    Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted.
                    A responding state shall use moneys made available from the insurance fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to apply for expenditures from the insurance fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
                    <ol class="listNumber">
                        <li>A detailed statement of the circumstances that occasion the request for the invoking of the compact.</li>
                        <li>Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass, or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.</li>
                        <li>A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefor, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned.</li>
                        <li>Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in subdivision 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in subdivision 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.</li>
                        <li>A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions that in its view occasion the invoking of the compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of moneys from the insurance fund in one year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program that is likely to continue for a longer period of time.</li>
                        <li>Such other information as the governing board may require consistent with the provisions of this compact.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The governing board or executive committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the insurance fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to the compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states.
                    The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon the submission as required by subsection C and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this compact and justified thereby, the governing board or executive committee shall authorize support of the program.
                    The governing board or the executive committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application.
                    Any and all determinations of the governing board or executive committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefor shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A requesting state that is dissatisfied with a determination of the executive committee shall upon notice in writing given within 20 days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the governing board.
                    Determinations of the executive committee shall be reviewable only by the governing board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the governing board may authorize.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this compact may receive moneys from the insurance fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the insurance fund.
                    The governing board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
                </li>
                <li>Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the insurance fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the insurance fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation that may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency of the federal government for such assistance and participation.</li>
                <li>The insurance fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the insurance fund, cooperating federal agencies, states and any other entities concerned.</li>
